Welcome to my website! I am a PhD Candidate at [New York University's Wilf Family's Department of Politics](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html).

My work sits at the intersection of International Political Economy and Historical Political Economy. Substantively, I am particularly interested in how international trade and market integration reshape the domestic balance of power. Methodologically, my research applies causal inference methods to historical microdata. In my dissertation, I analyze how three distinct moments of globalization---the first era of globalization, interwar deglobalization, and the Washington Consensus era---contributed to elite splits and anti-regime mobilization in Latin America. 

Before attending NYU, I received a M.A. in Social Sciences from the [Juan March-Carlos III Institute](https://ic3jm.es/en/) (Madrid) and a B.A. in Economics from [Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE)](https://www.cide.edu/).
